# TIL
> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small tidbits I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. 

## About
I shamelessly stole this idea from [jbranchaud/til](github.com/jbranchaud/til). This is my way of [#LearninginPublic](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) to showcase the learnings I've built overtime. Feel free to open issues for corrections. I am very open to learning from my mistakes.
