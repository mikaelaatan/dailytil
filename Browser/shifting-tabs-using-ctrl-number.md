Currently using Microsoft Edge and I accidentally discovered that you can shift tabs using Ctrl + 1,2,3 depending on the order of the tab.

To recreate:
1. Open Microsoft Edge.
2. Open at least 3 tabs. 
3. On your keyboard, use CTRL+1 to go to the 1st tab. 
	- CTRL+2 to go to the 2nd tab... and so on.
